  Can you keep the mathematical expressions in your head and use them to select numbers for a short time? Yes? Well! Full ahead!
intro2=The idea of the game is simple. The player must keep up to click on the numbers that appear on the circle display for a limited period of time. He must do it in accordance with the conditions at the beginning of the level. Do you think it is easy? Not really. The player should consider different bonuses and penalties. In addition, numbers will change faster and conditions will become more difficult with each level.
howToPlay=***   How to play:   ***\n\n\
  The game is divided into episodes, and each can contain from 3 to 5 levels. After completing all the levels of one episode, the player goes to the next. If a player loses all his lives during the passing episode, he will have to start over this episode. The player has 5 lives at the beginning of the game. The player gets one life for every 1000 game points.\n\n\
  At the beginning of each level the player has game conditions by which he must need to select a number on the circle display. He has to select the true number in a short time. If the player clicks on the correct number or misses the wrong one, he earns game points (for every number he earns 10 points * episode level, for example, in the first episode he earns 10 points, in the second - 20 points and so on). Otherwise, he loses his life.\n\n\
  As well, there are surprises in the game. Surprises are good (bonuses, for example, extra lives or points, time dilation, explosion of numbers) and bad (penalties, for example, reduction of lives or points, different distortions of the game screen).\n\n\
  Let's look at an example. Suppose that according to the game condition the numbers should be divided by 3. And game start the count from 1 and then add 2 to each next number (that is, it will be 1, 3, 5 ...). So, the player should click on 3, 9, 15, 21 and so on until the end of the game, because these numbers are divided by 3. But if the player chooses 5, then he will lose his life.
howToPlay2=***   How to play (in detail):   ***\n\n\
  Game Terms. The game conditions for choosing numbers are shown at the beginning of each level.\n\n\
  1) Conditions of the appearance of numbers: Numbers can appear according to a certain rule (for example, the game starts the count from 5 and then add 2 to each next number, that is, it will be 5, 7, 9 ...) or arbitrarily (32, 15, 51 ...).\n\n\
  2) Time conditions for the move: The player has specific times for the move and for the rest after the move. The times are written in the game conditions of the level. But there may be complications. For example, each subsequent move may become shorter with time.\n\n\
  3) Game conditions for choosing numbers: To select a number, the player must follow the game conditions prescribed at the beginning of the level. Conditions can be connected by the word AND (conditions must be met at the same time) or by the word OR (at least one condition must be true). Number of conditions are as follows:\n\n\
  * divisibility (the number on circle display is divided by a fixed number in condition, for example 33 is divisible by 3)\n\
  * the end of the number by some number, ten, hundred and so on (for example, 53 ends with 3)\n\
  * whether the number is prime or composite (prime is when the number is divided entirely by itself or by 1, for example 19)\n\
  * whether the number is a perfect square (you can take the square root of it, for example, from 25 you can take 5). If you do not know how to take the square root, it does not matter. You just need to remember that if the resulting answer is multiplied by itself, then we get the initial condition - for 81 this is 9, and 9 times 9 = 81. You can take a square root\n\
  * whether the sum of the digits of the number is equal to a certain constant (for example, for 475 and 385, the sum of the digits is 16)\n\
  * whether the multiplication of the digits of the number is equal to some constant (for example, for 23 and 16, the product of the digits is 6)\n\
  * whether the sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression (starting from the second number each subsequent number is equal to the sum of the previous number and the common difference. For example, 5, 7, 9, 11 is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2)\n\
  * whether the sequence is a geometric progression (starting from the second number each subsequent number is equal to the previous one multiplied by the common ratio. For example, 5, 10, 20, 40 is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2)\n\n\
  Example: The number is divided by 2 OR the multiplication of the digits is 5. The game starts the count from 1 and then add 1 to the next number (1, 2, 3 ...). The correct answers are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15 ...\n\n\
  Bonuses. Besides numbers there are surprises in the game. They can significantly affect the game. Surprises are divided into good (bonuses) and bad (penalties).\n\n\
  Bonuses:\n\n\
  * increased lives or game points.\n\
  * slowing down time.\n\
  * explosion of numbers (skipping several numbers without losing lives).\n\
  * hint (indicates whether to click on a number or not).\n\
  Penalties:\n\n\
  * reduced lives or game points.\n\
  * acceleration of time.\n\
  * color music (flashing colors are unlikely to help the player better concentrate on the game).\n\
  * invert colors (light colors become dark colors and dark becomes light).\n\
  * rotation of the circle display with numbers.\n\
  * movement of the circle display with numbers.\n\
  * various distortion of the circle display with numbers.
